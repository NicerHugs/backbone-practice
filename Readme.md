## First attempt at using backbone

This was created with TDD, all tests were written before the code that causes them to pass. It did take a long time to write all the tests, but by the time it came to actually making my (bare bones) app exist, I ultimately just wrote 2 lines of code. That was pretty cool.

Didn't manage to get the models working, although I spent the majority of my time attempting to. Couldn't find good simple documentation for such a basic example that really showed implementation of them.

As such, 2 of my tests are still failing as they were intended to test the app based on using the model to create it.
